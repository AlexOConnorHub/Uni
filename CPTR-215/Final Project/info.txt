  Run `pip install -r req.txt` to install dependencies
    bottle==0.12.19
    gevent==20.9.0

Known weak points:
    Currently, usernames that are not valid filenames will cause unexpected results.
        For avatars, I rename the file username.ext, meaning if username is changed
        by bottle to be a valid filename, then it will not be displayed for anyone 
        on the site.

    Chat filter could be a lot better. I grabbed a list that was almost 3000 words
        long, but removed 500 because the way I was filtering meant that they would
        never cause a chat to be flagged. In an ideal world, I would like for chats
        with flagged content to be visible to those who allow unfiltered chat, but
        as that requires more settings, time, and management, I simply restricted
        free speech. The way I filter chat is by going through word by word and 
        checking if it is in the banned list. I could probably do better to check
        if any of the list is in the chat.

    Currently, Every 5 seconds or so, the web browser pings the server asking if there 
        are any new chats. There is most likely a better way to do this, as it causes 
        excess web traffic for users and server.

    Chat logging works fine, and even has a variable hard log, but if this is completely
        empty, the server will not start, with JSON errors. I have a message to the server
        admin in there as a placeholder.
